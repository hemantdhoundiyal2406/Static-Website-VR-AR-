          <p>
            We believe that Augmented and Virtual reality technology is an extremely potential tool in the fields of Education, Training, Architecture, Healthcare, Tourism, Remote Collaboration, Fashion, Security, and Gaming. However, due to costly hardware, and lack of affordable courses and content, its adoption is hampered in countries, especially the developing ones like India. But, with our pocket-friendly patented hardware and exclusively designed learning resources, we envision making India a superpower in AR-VR content generation and aim to build the world's largest AR-VR Developer's base in India.
